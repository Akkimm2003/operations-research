# Operations research
**Operations research** is a complex scientific discipline in which scientific principles, mathematical (quantitative) methods are applied to justify decisions in all areas of purposeful human activity, the main task of which is to find the best or at least satisfactory ways to achieve this goal.
# Lab1(Simplex Method)
**Simplex method** is an iterative computational procedure that allows, starting from a certain reference plan, for a finite number of steps to obtain the optimal plan of the linear programming problem.

# Simplex Method Implementation

## Overview
The Simplex Method is a powerful algorithm for solving linear programming problems. This implementation provides a solution for maximization problems using the tableau form of the Simplex Method.

## Problem Formulation
The example solves a linear programming problem with the following characteristics:
- 4 decision variables (x1, x2, x3, x4)
- 3 constraints
- Objective function to maximize profit

## Initial Tableau Structure
The tableau is structured as follows:

| Basis | x1 | x2 | x3 | x4 | x5 | x6 | x7 | RHS |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| x5    | 3  | 5  | 47 | 2  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 65 |
| x6    | 20 | 13 | 18 | 31 | 0  | 1  | 0  | 400|
| x7    | 9  | 15 | 7  | 16 | 0  | 0  | 1  | 130|
| Z     | -30| -20| -50| -45| 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |

Where:
- First column represents the basis variables
- Middle columns represent coefficients for variables (including slack variables s1, s2, s3)
- Last column (RHS) represents the right-hand side values (free terms)

## Implementation Details

The `SimplexMethod` class contains several key methods:

1. `Solve()`: Main method that iteratively improves the solution
2. `FindPivotColumn()`: Identifies the entering variable
3. `FindPivotRow()`: Determines the leaving variable
4. `PerformPivot()`: Executes row operations to update the tableau
5. `PrintSolution()`: Outputs the optimal solution
6. `PrintTable()`: Displays the current tableau

## Example Usage

```csharp
double[,] tableau = {
    {5, 3, 5, 47, 2, 1, 0, 0, 65 },
    {6, 20, 13, 18, 31, 0, 1, 0, 400 },
    {7, 9, 15, 7, 16, 0, 0, 1, 130 },
    {0, -30, -20, -50, -45, 0, 0, 0, 0 }
};
SimplexMethod simplex = new SimplexMethod(tableau);
simplex.Solve();
```

## Algorithm Steps

1. Initialize the tableau with the problem coefficients
2. Find the pivot column (most negative value in the objective row)
3. Find the pivot row (smallest positive ratio of RHS to pivot column)
4. Perform pivot operations to update the tableau
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until no negative values remain in the objective row
6. Extract and display the optimal solution

## Termination Conditions

The algorithm terminates when either:
- An optimal solution is found (no negative values in objective row)
- The problem has no feasible solution

## Output

The program outputs:
- Intermediate tableaus at each iteration
- Final optimal values for all variables
- Maximum profit achieved

## Time Complexity

The Simplex Method's worst-case time complexity is exponential, but it performs well in practice for most real-world problems.

## Notes

- This implementation assumes the initial basic feasible solution is provided
- The tableau must be in standard form before using this implementation
- All constraints are assumed to be in "â‰¤" form
